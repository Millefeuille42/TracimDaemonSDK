# MiniClient

A demo client that just logs event

## Usage

Build and run the client with

```bash
go run .
```

This client assumes that `/tmp/tracim_master.sock` is the master socket path
and that `/tmp/tracim_mini_client.sock` is it's socket path.

It is not really designed to be used, it's more of an example of how to use the SDK.
